description: "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the\
  \ unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790;\
  \ however, Franklin himself appears to have called the work his Memoirs. Although\
  \ it had a tortuous publication history after Franklin's death, this work has become\
  \ one of the most famous and influential examples of an autobiography ever written.\n\
  Franklin's account of his life is divided into four parts, reflecting the different\
  \ periods at which he wrote them. There are actual breaks in the narrative between\
  \ the first three parts, but Part Three's narrative continues into Part Four without\
  \ an authorial break (only an editorial one).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
